At 30 feet tall, Porthcawl Lighthouse, designed by the eminent engineer James Walker, is often pictured being battered by waves when storms hit. The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl Lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the UK to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm.","date":"Nov 18, 2024","bsTitle":"Guiding the way since 1860","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241118_PorthcawlLighthouse%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6010ac5d1edcb7478a2646544f10d5ed","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
