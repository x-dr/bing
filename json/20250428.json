Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.","date":"Apr 28, 2025","bsTitle":"Pause and pose","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250428_OrangeImpala%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"eeb3aa8123e0dcf02f01acdb9bcb052f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
