This calendar follows the phases of the moon and the rhythms of the seasons. Red lanterns—like the ones shown in today's image—are widely associated with the celebration. The holiday falls on the new moon between January 21 and February 20 and has been observed for more than 2,000 years. In 2024, UNESCO added the Spring Festival to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, recognizing its cultural and historical importance.","date":"Feb 17, 2026","bsTitle":"Fifteen days of light","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260217_NewYearLantern%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2d5949b03aedc530364c45ee5b054a12","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
