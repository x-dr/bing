That's exactly what sloths do, and today, we celebrate them. International Sloth Day honors these unhurried creatures and reminds us that life doesn't always need to be rushed. Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals native to Central and South America. Their deliberate movements conserve energy, avoid predators, and even allow algae to grow on their fur, creating green camouflage among the canopy. Hoffmann's two-toed sloth, pictured here, is a prime example of the slow-paced lifestyle typical of all sloths. It spends most of its time in the trees, occasionally descending to the ground to move to a new one.","date":"Oct 20, 2025","bsTitle":"Life in the slow lane","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251020_HoffmansSloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9bdeecf354b647e3c33fcc669b61f41f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
