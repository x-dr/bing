These birds migrate from Siberia and the Russian Far East, choosing Japan as their seasonal home because its lakes offer what long-distance travelers crave: open water, steady food, and a safe place to rest. One of their favorite destinations is Kotoku Pond in the Kantō region on Japan's largest island.","date":"Dec 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Whoop, there they fly","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251230_JapanSwans%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"801dc22821ab6d838894ef9abba17e1e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
