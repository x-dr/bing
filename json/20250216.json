This year, on February 16, we honor these majestic creatures, like the humpback whale pictured in today's image, known for its enchanting songs and dramatic breaches. World Whale Day began in 1980 in Maui, Hawaii, led by Greg Kauffman of the Pacific Whale Foundation, to protect humpbacks from extinction. Today, it urges global action on threats like ocean pollution, climate change, and habitat loss.","date":"Feb 16, 2025","bsTitle":"Protecting the giants of the sea","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250216_HumpbackMother%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bdeb5946d2f0637b96cd323880ebaf3c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
