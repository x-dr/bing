With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places where others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border.","date":"Feb 5, 2025","bsTitle":"Baa, baa, black sheep?
