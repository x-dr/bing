World Lake Day is the perfect occasion to explore this optical illusion in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous administrative division of the Kingdom of Denmark. Also called Leitisvatn, this lake on the island of Vágar appears to float far above the ocean. In reality, it sits less than 100 feet above sea level.
