Held on the full moon of the second month of the Lanna lunar calendar, this celebration is about letting go of negativity and embracing new beginnings. The highlight of the festival is the release of 'khom loi' or 'khom loy'—floating paper lanterns—into the night sky, which becomes a sea of warm, golden lights. People often write their hopes and dreams on the lanterns. They gather around temples and palaces to send their wishes skyward, hoping for good fortune in the year to come.","date":"Nov 15, 2024","bsTitle":"Hope takes flight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241115_YiPengLanterns%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"de0be56f78756dfe428fedc26c310758","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
