Native to North America, these sheep are known for their distinctive curled horns, which can weigh up to 30 pounds. Rams use their massive horns in intense head-butting contests. During these battles, they hurl themselves at each other in charges of up to 20 miles per hour. Ewes, on the other hand, tend to keep things more low-key, forming smaller groups with their lambs. Adapted to the desert environment, the desert bighorn sheep sub-species can go long periods without water, relying on moisture from plants to survive.","date":"Mar 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Rocky relationship","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250306_NevadaBigHorns%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e3e892a6f959b4b495c2cd0d9fdee55e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
