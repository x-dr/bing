This fortress has seen it all—battles, power shifts, and royal connections. Originally built in the 14th century, the medieval castle was designed to guard the Loire River and control access to the region. Over time, it evolved into a residence for nobility, most notably serving as the home of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, who was a trusted minister of King Henry IV. The castle played a significant role during the French Wars of Religion from 1562 to 1598 and has witnessed countless moments of intrigue and diplomacy. In 1940, during World War II, the castle wall was hit by shells, creating massive holes, but the framework remained intact.","date":"Mar 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Standing strong","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250312_ChateauLoire%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"45fe5787a4b60dae03afb06fb90d4897","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
