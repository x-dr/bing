Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty.","date":"Dec 8, 2024","bsTitle":"The comeback of Notre-Dame","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241208_ReopeningNotreDame%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"05f13150fe2737f6dc266801f95aa09a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
