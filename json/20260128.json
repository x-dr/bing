Established in 1986, the park covers about 286 square miles across the central North Island, with the Whanganui River tracing long, quiet bends through dense forest. Although the river is not officially within the park's boundaries, it shapes nearly everything around it, including the Whanganui Journey—one of New Zealand's designated Great Walks.","date":"Jan 28, 2026","bsTitle":"Flow with it","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260128_WhanganuiPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"16a5ef4418c84317a25965db260ac087","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
