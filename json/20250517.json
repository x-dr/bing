Spanning over 212 square miles, this lagoon is a rich mosaic of islands, mudflats, canals, and marshes, and it's one of the largest wetlands in the entire Mediterranean Basin. The lagoon isn't just a scenic wonder—it's a place steeped in history and innovation. Formed after the last Ice Age, it became a refuge for people fleeing invasions around the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476. In the centuries that followed, those early settlers began building what would eventually become the iconic city of Venice.","date":"May 17, 2025","bsTitle":"The Venetian 'dolce vita'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250517_VeniceLagoon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a25ee7ed8cd284675e2da84967884788","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
