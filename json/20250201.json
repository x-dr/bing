The forerunner of Black History Month was created in 1926 by historian Carter Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland to study and promote the legacy of Black Americans. The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February.","date":"Feb 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Roots of freedom","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250201_AfricanMuseumDC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"b8d20e265d6b3352531ebfee57e451ad","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
