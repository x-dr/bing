Originally known as Decoration Day, the tradition began in the late 1860s after the American Civil War. Communities held springtime tributes by decorating the graves of fallen Union soldiers with flowers. Over time, it expanded to commemorate all US military personnel who died in wars. Locals observe the day with ceremonies and parades across the country.","date":"May 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Honoring the fallen","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250526_ArlingtonSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1a1aff22d72320900862e756448b66f1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
