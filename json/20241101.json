Throughout November, we honor the history, traditions, stories, and languages of Native Peoples. The Indigenous Peoples of North America have played a significant role in shaping our country, including the food we eat and the medicines that heal us. In addition to being a celebration, this month is also a time to reflect on the issues that Native Peoples face, including civil and voting rights, land access, and education.","date":"Nov 1, 2024","bsTitle":"Celebrating America's Native heritage","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241101_HovenweepRuins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3392ddaba339ae21f9ad11e001863cd4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
