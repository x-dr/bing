The Sibiu Christmas Market, known in Romanian as Târgul de Crăciun din Sibiu, is held in the central square from the end of November until early January. Sparkling strings of lights drape across the square, seen in today's image, creating a canopy that bathes the cobblestone streets in a warm, festive glow. There also stands a beautifully lit Christmas tree, surrounded by charming wooden huts selling everything from handcrafted ornaments to locally made treats like cozonac, a traditional Romanian sweet bread; vin fiert, an aromatic mulled wine; and covrigi, a type of pretzel served warm and sprinkled with salt.","date":"Dec 19, 2024","bsTitle":"Twinkle town","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241219_SibiuRomania%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d20d7a090716e25752a053c760cd92bd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
