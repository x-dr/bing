Tucked away on Ireland's wild and beautiful Dingle Peninsula, Dunquin Pier is one of the most photogenic spots in County Kerry. The small pier is famous for its winding, serpentine path that zigzags dramatically down the cliffside like a ribbon. These steep curves aren't just for the thrill—they're the only way to reach the pier below, where boats depart for the remote Blasket Islands.","date":"Sep 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Ireland's western edge","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250918_DunquinIreland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2309f2b12dd2ba8227c5b29e3a3aefbf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
