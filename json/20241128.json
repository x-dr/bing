The tradition dates back to English colonists who celebrated the first Thanksgiving in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621. Their treacherous journey from England the year before and their first winter claimed half of the colonists, and the rest might have died too if not for the generosity of the Wampanoag people. To celebrate their first corn harvest and thank the Native Americans who helped them, the colonists held a three-day feast.","date":"Nov 28, 2024","bsTitle":"Stuffed with gratitude","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241128_TomTurkeys%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"604dd83d7548854d31372971d6495cb0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
