The story of this 'Wonder of the West' goes back to the early 8th century, when Archangel Michael was said to have appeared to the bishop of Avranches in a vision. The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims, and invaders alike.","date":"Nov 29, 2024","bsTitle":"An island of time and tide","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241129_MtStMichel%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6d23526d2588856c12a177693540b5db","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
