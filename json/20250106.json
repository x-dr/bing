This Romanesque church, originally built in 450, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided by two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: The basement crypt, or burial chamber, is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time.","date":"Jan 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Divine depths","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250106_RavennaBasilica%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"099a25f64c8af867c2c6f739472d0e96","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
