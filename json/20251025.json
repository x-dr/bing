This reserve is more than just mires—it carries layers of history. During Finland's Prohibition era (1919–1932), smugglers hauled sacks of liquor from Sweden across these bogs, following a 'spirits' route that passed through Martimoaapa. Parts of that path can still be traced today. Imagine trekking with a heavy pack over soggy ground—would you have made it?","date":"Oct 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Finland's living peatland","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251025_MartimoaapaFinland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d109b1ccd6d0c4d0ad0c6273fa895f95","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
