That's exactly the spirit of World Hello Day, celebrated every November 21. This cheerful observance began in 1973 when two American brothers, Brian and Michael McCormack, launched it as a peaceful response to global tensions. They mailed 1,360 letters in seven languages to world leaders, inviting them to join the first celebration. Their message was simple yet powerful: personal communication can help preserve peace. Today, people in more than 180 countries participate.","date":"Nov 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Sealed with a hello","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251121_SealWaving%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4167fdc239aa45dc32629176d12c7636","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
