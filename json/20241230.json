Covering more than 60 square miles, it's one of the state's oldest national parks. As you follow the winding road up through the park, you'll see a whole range of landscapes, from temperate rainforests full of some of the world's tallest eucalyptus trees to alpine moorland. These ever-changing views are what give the park its nickname, 'the park for all seasons.' One of the park's must-visit sites is Russell Falls, a three-tiered waterfall that plunges 190 feet.","date":"Dec 30, 2024","bsTitle":"A park for all seasons","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241230_MountFieldNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"025b455261fb11b6bd7b3494d52708ae","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
