It's a global celebration of resilience, rights, and remarkable women. First observed in the early 1900s, the day traces its roots to labor movements led by women fighting for better pay, improved working conditions, and voting rights. From its beginnings in 1911, when over a million people attended rallies in Europe, the day has grown into a worldwide movement. Today, it's marked by events, protests, and campaigns addressing issues like gender pay gaps, domestic violence, and access to education. From trailblazers like Marie Curie, who illuminated science, to Malala Yousafzai, who champions education, women have proven time and again that they don't just participate; they innovate.","date":"Mar 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Making her-story!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250308_FearlessWomen%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"0404456a0fa28635fb6f6163c71d8735","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
