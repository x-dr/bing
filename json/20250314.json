Today is Pi Day, an event that celebrates this mathematical constant. This date was chosen because 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of pi (π) when it is written out. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it can't be written as a fraction. When written out, its decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating. The oldest attempts to calculate pi date back to ancient Babylon and Egypt, around 1900 BCE.","date":"Mar 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Pi in the sky","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250314_BasqueDolmen%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8dfcd62f09fbbeed1b4eeceab8c01177","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
