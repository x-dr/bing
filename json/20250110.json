Abraham Lake in Alberta, Canada, has them during the winter, and they're not just beautiful—they're science in action. Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a human-made reservoir that spans more than 20 square miles along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. Glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum.","date":"Jan 10, 2025","bsTitle":"Bubbles, bubbles everywhere","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250110_BubbleLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3b23fa94a9cad27d79b0568850bdd504","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
