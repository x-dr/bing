The state of Victoria's largest salt lake was formed around 120,000 years ago. Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles.","date":"Feb 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Salt of the earth","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250213_LakeTyrrell%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"607b20cdd23ae96225798b3447cff211","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
