That's a whole new vibe. This off-the-beaten-path island, part of the Bali province, is where nature gets a little wild, and the sights are nothing short of epic. With its rugged cliffs and crystal-clear waters, the island offers an escape from Bali's busier tourist hubs. The name 'Nusa Penida' translates to 'island of priests,' and historically, it served as a spiritual retreat, with temples and rituals that locals still honor today.","date":"Mar 11, 2025","bsTitle":"When the ocean breaks the rules","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250311_NusaPenida%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c2d074b9fe4cef886301ad6f2df5cef5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
