A day that New Zealanders still commemorate: Waitangi Day. On this date, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, establishing the principles for how the two cultures would coexist. Ceremonies are held at Waitangi Treaty Grounds—where the document was signed—featuring traditional Māori performances, speeches, and the ever-dramatic waka (canoe) races. From festivals and concerts in cities like Auckland and Wellington to low-key community gatherings, the spirit of the day is about connection and culture.","date":"Feb 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Reflections of a nation's legacy","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250206_WhararikiBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c88488c53938fda64e5941ceb3ec09d5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
