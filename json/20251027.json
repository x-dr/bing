At nearly 28 inches in length and weighing more than 3 pounds, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 3.5 inches long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 5,000 and 11,200 feet above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs, and even rooftops in mountain towns.","date":"Oct 27, 2025","bsTitle":"Bigger, bolder, beakier","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251027_AfricanRaven%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b53144c848e1f094b0492790f6da3e8b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
