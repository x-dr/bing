From the moment the chicks hatch, the male lesser rhea takes full charge—guiding them through the brush, communicating with gentle whistles, and sheltering them under his wings in times of danger or cold. Remarkably, he often adopts lost chicks, raising a mixed-age brood. For nearly 6 months, this bird father teaches and protects the chicks, with many staying close until maturity. Talk about going above and beyond for your kids!","date":"Jun 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Feathered father figure","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250615_RheaDad%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b1849cfb22286b229c2b16ef410473bc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
