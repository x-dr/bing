The 'La Fée Electricité' (The Spirit of Electricity) is housed at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This stunning artwork was created for the Pavilion of Light and Electricity at the 1937 International Exhibition of Art and Technology in Modern Life. The painting was inspired by the poem 'On the Nature of Things,' written by Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius. Raoul Dufy's work vividly depicts the evolution of electricity through two main themes: the history of electricity and its applications.","date":"May 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Let's visit a museum today","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250518_DufyRoom%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"6f453dde536ef515de0a3e5895703847","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
