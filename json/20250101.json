Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts.","date":"Jan 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Have an ice New Year's Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250101_PolarBearSwim%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5ef197c346f1ef0ce1289f97f5fa518b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
