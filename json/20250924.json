Once called Bear Lodge, the butte gained its current name during an 1875 expedition led by Colonel Richard Irving Dodge, possibly after an interpreter mistranslated a Native phrase as 'Bad God's Tower.' The missing apostrophe in its official title follows standard geographic naming conventions—hence, the signs read 'Devils Tower.' In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it the nation's first national monument; a milestone whose anniversary falls today.","date":"Sep 24, 2025","bsTitle":"The lonely giant","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250924_BearLodge%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"543d315ebce4fd35f68974fa4ecdf015","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
