Among the most prominent is Amber Fort, also known as Amer Fort or Amber Palace, which is perched on a small hill about 7 miles from the main city of Jaipur. Within its regal walls lies the Sattais Katcheri, which means 'court of 27 pillars,' featured in today's image. Amber Fort was built in 1592 and it served as the residence of the maharajas, or rulers, of the area. Famous for its unique blend of Hindu, Rajput, and Mughal architectural styles, it is constructed from pale yellow and pink sandstone alongside white marble. This masterpiece is spread across four levels, each with its own courtyard. Part of the wider Hill Forts of Rajasthan UNESCO World Heritage Site, Amber Fort invites visitors to explore a rich blend of history and royalty.","date":"Dec 3, 2024","bsTitle":"Pillars of the past","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241203_JaipurFort%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0ff64c98509f50c385526b46d22cbef8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
