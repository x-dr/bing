The 19-mile Mount Hamilton Road is loved by cyclists and motorcyclists for its long climbs and sparse traffic. Built in 1875-76, the road was designed to transport materials to the Lick Observatory, the world's first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory. On a clear day, you can see as far as Yosemite National Park or the Sierra Nevada from the 4,265-foot summit.","date":"May 19, 2025","bsTitle":"Twists and turns of Mount Hamilton","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250519_MountHamilton%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a30120e1a3015965ea39c5e0cea44ce5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
