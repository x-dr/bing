Enter Mona Vale Rockpool in Sydney, Australia—a watery paradox where the ocean is wild beyond the walls and well-behaved within its calm, contained edges. Perched in Sydney's Northern Beaches area—this rock pool feels more like a natural wonder than a human-made one. Built in the 1930s during the Depression, it was carved out of a natural rock shelf as part of an unemployment relief scheme. Upgraded over time, the pool is nearly 100 feet long and flanked by a smaller children's pool. The pools are free, open year-round, and cleaned regularly by both council crews and the ocean itself. So next time you are in Sydney, make a splash where the waves meet the wall. It's a shore thing.","date":"May 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A shore thing","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250527_MonaValePool%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d61c9e33651309e2e352f506ac68a78d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
