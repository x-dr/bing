It's a time to dust off well-worn copies of 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit,' and journey once more into the lands of elves, dwarves, and one particularly famous ring. But why this date?

Schools, libraries, and fans worldwide take part, reading passages aloud, discussing favorite moments, and diving into the rich lore of Middle-earth. Some go all out with themed events, cosplay, and even second breakfasts—because what better way to honor Tolkien than by feasting like a hobbit?","date":"Mar 25, 2025","bsTitle":"In a hole, there was a story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250325_HobbitHole%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"962bec39ab6c39cfab58db5d637b967c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
