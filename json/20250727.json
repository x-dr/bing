These streamlined fish, marked by sharp V-shaped stripes, move in near-perfect unison. Their slow, deliberate spirals aren't random—they're an evolutionary strategy that offers both safety in numbers and an edge in hunting. Blackfin barracudas are found throughout tropical waters, from the Red Sea to the central Pacific. During the day, they gather in tight, coordinated groups near the reef, scattering at dusk to pursue prey.","date":"Jul 27, 2025","bsTitle":"Shimmer in sync","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250727_BlackfinBarracuda%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"41e850f15f5df3147d932c65fbf6049f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
