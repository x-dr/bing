These fiery sandstone creations, part of the Schnebly Hill Formation, were shaped over millions of years during the Permian Period as sediment accumulated in an ancient sea. Over time, erosion has further sculpted Sedona's landscapes, which now glow brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. Notable formations such as Wilson Mountain, Seven Sacred Pools, and Cathedral Rock offer iconic views.","date":"Mar 18, 2025","bsTitle":"A vortex state of mind","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250318_SedonaSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8da7221bc817302fdbde4b510a322988","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
