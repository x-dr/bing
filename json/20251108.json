The town began as a small settlement in the 1850s and grew into a center for timber and salmon fishing. Cranberries became a key crop and are still celebrated each September during the Cranberry Festival. Old Town reflects that past with boardwalk cafés and galleries, while the Coquille River Lighthouse stands restored at Bullards Beach as a reminder of the days when its beacon guided ships.","date":"Nov 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Rock stars of Bandon","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251108_BandonBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"923f9f6fec3082aacfe2ecb53721e9f6","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
