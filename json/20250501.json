On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.","date":"May 1, 2025","bsTitle":"A fragrant tradition","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250501_PinkPlumeria%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"868b1a2c5efa022611fdfcdd23fd21ac","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
