This year's celebration takes place from June 16 to 22. It shines a spotlight on the birds, bats, bees, butterflies, beetles, and other animals that help pollinate nearly 90% of flowering plants—including many of the fruits, vegetables, and nuts we love. Featured here is the Asian swallowtail, captured on a red spider lily. Found across Northeast Asia and even parts of Hawaii, this striking butterfly uses its keen color vision to find flowers, especially those from citrus families. While it is common and not currently threatened, its role as a pollinator is no less important.","date":"Jun 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Let the pollinating games begin!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250618_AsianSwallowtail%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"faef601a0f32b104197ec06fcafa8998","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
