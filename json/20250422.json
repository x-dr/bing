The largest hot spring in the US, it spans 370 feet across and reaches temperatures of 160°F. This geothermal marvel is fueled by the immense heat of the massive Yellowstone volcano beneath the surface. Its vivid rings of blue, green, yellow, and orange are created by heat-loving microorganisms—called thermophiles—that thrive in the mineral-rich waters.","date":"Apr 22, 2025","bsTitle":"'Our Power, Our Planet'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250422_YellowstoneSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a8ef42c9727909ecf8d8b3ad4249adab","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
