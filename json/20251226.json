Churches joined in by opening alms boxes and distributing donations.","date":"Dec 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Unboxed traditions","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251226_WiltshireDawn%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"880bdcc06f9c9505349f3c8714048764","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
