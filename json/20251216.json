Meet the gnome—known as 'tomte' in Sweden and 'nisse' in Norway—whose traditions vary across regions. Rooted in Scandinavian folklore, these tiny guardians watch over homes and farms, keeping families safe through long, dark winters. But there's a catch: treat them kindly, or they may play tricks. A warm bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve is their favorite reward. Said to bring luck and laughter, they might even befriend your garden gnomes, since they often resemble them.","date":"Dec 16, 2025","bsTitle":"Tiny hats, big spirits","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251216_ChristmasGnomes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0961c7f63c64ac354b541cab895daa28","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
