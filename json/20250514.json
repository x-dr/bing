Porto Flavia on the Italian island of Sardinia took a completely different approach. This engineering marvel transformed a cliff into a gateway for Sardinia's ore industry. Mining in the area has a history dating back thousands of years, from the Phoenicians and Romans to the industrial boom in the 20th century. Lead, zinc, coal, sulfur, barium, and silver were extracted from these rugged hills, but transporting them was a logistical nightmare. Ore had to be hauled by cart, loaded onto small boats, and then transferred to larger ships—a slow, costly, and inefficient process.","date":"May 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Ore and more","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250514_SardiniaFlavia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"09997e089f2efa0642a133e6893feb3c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
