It stands as a proud witness to the valor of the famed warrior clans—the Rajputs. Their name comes from the Sanskrit 'rajaputra,' meaning 'son of a king,' and they are celebrated for their noble lineage and martial traditions across northern India. The fort's stone walls have witnessed centuries of courage, pride, and romance, remembered in the songs of Rajasthan's bards. According to legend, Bhim, a hero from the Hindu epic 'Mahabharata,' first laid its foundations.","date":"Sep 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Carved stones of courage","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250925_FortChittorgarh%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4595c8d1e2017ad912c91f0ac46a9551","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
