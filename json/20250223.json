The country's tallest mountain rises 12,000 feet above the surrounding landscape, with its near-symmetrical cone covered in snow for nearly five months each year. For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain.","date":"Feb 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Wind of Fuji, my souvenir from Edo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250223_MtFujiSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"54c4843dabf941fbf038350cc92ed5c0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
