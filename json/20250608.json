This year, World Oceans Day is being celebrated in Nice, France, just ahead of the UN Ocean Conference starting tomorrow. Officially recognized by the United Nations since 2008, it began as an idea at the 1992 Global Forum, a parallel event at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. This year's theme is 'WONDER: Sustaining What Sustains Us.' It highlights how the ocean supports life as we know it—influencing weather, food chains, and economies.","date":"Jun 8, 2025","bsTitle":"Hello from the other side","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250608_StellarSeaLions%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f7d73289096c647c5ca8ebf0aff9d987","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
