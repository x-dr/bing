They are agile divers, plunging beneath the surface to catch fish and other prey. Males, known as drakes, stand out with their fan-shaped white crests, dark heads, and chestnut-brown sides, while females, called hens, are brownish gray with smaller crests. Oregon's lakes and wetlands provide sheltered feeding grounds as these birds migrate or winter across the continent.","date":"Nov 18, 2025","bsTitle":"Fall's feathered headliner","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251118_AutumnMerganser%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"54f4edfbe7304ee81dcba7f356e2a598","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
