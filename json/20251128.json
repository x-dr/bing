Think again—today is Native American Heritage Day. Established in 2009, it celebrates the voices, art, and achievements of Indigenous peoples across the United States. This day is a reminder to look beyond parades and sales and learn from the experiences of those who first shaped this land. Communities host cultural events, storytelling sessions, and feasts featuring dishes like Three Sisters soup, wild rice, pemmican, beans, squash, and buffalo stew—each carrying centuries of legacy.","date":"Nov 28, 2025","bsTitle":"Wear your heritage","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251128_ConchaBelt%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"c316477f882f3e528b6ae7ef502580e8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
