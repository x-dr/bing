Migratory birds navigate the globe, instinctively knowing when and where to move to exploit seasonal abundance. The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering roughly 25,000 miles in its annual round trip.","date":"Oct 12, 2024","bsTitle":"It's time to wing it!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241012_QuebecDuck%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"215ce21f492d2e933a637400a2fe61d0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
