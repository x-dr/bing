On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira—an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.","date":"Oct 29, 2025","bsTitle":"Rooted in time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251029_FanalForest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"6228544f9382dcfe0d32a27a2d2ffd13","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
