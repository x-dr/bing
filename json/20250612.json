Efforts to preserve this 801,163-acre area of West Texas began in the 1930s and culminated in its official designation as a park on June 12, 1944. Big Bend remains one of the most remote and least-visited national parks in the country. It's not just one landscape, it's three: the Chihuahuan Desert, the Chisos Mountains (pictured here), and the Rio Grande. Big Bend sits on the US–Mexico border, and its history reflects that blend. Indigenous peoples, Spanish explorers, ranchers, miners, and modern travelers have all left their footprints. Petroglyphs, ruins, and old trails show the land's story began long before it became a park.","date":"Jun 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Stars, stone, and solitude","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250612_BigBendChisos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"98af9026e3f35d5abff4ebd6b1c7640b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
