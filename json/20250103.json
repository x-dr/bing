Tolkien!","copyrightonly":"© atiger/Shutterstock","desc":"'Don't adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story.' Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honor the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and beyond. Tolkienists are encouraged to celebrate the author's birthday with a toast at 9 PM local time—to participate, all you must do is stand and raise a glass of your choice, say 'The Professor,' and take a sip.","date":"Jan 3, 2025","bsTitle":"Ring in the fun","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250103_TolkienOxford%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3b04c78beb6ae009894cc3a06a5b1a4e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
