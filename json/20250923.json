A member of the Ramphastidae family, which includes toucan barbets, it is one of more than 40 toucan species. Found from southern Mexico to northern Colombia, it spends much of its day plucking fruit with a rainbow-colored bill about one-third of its total length. It also eats insects, eggs, and small reptiles when available. The bill not only helps it eat but also keeps the toucan cool by radiating excess heat—thanks to the blood vessels running through it. This social bird often moves in small groups, chattering and gliding between treetops. With each wing measuring 7–8 inches, the keel-billed toucan molts, or sheds its feathers, just once a year.","date":"Sep 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Beak-side story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250923_ToucanForest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b8af7ba71fadb07f7d0f2f6137a61d9b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
