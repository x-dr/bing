The medieval mathematician popularized the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, with its use of zero, decimal points, and 10 numbers instead of the ponderous Roman numeral system. He's most famous, however, for his sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... By adding the first two numbers, you arrive at the third, and adding the previous two numbers, you arrive at the next number, and so on. Disregarding the zero, the first four numbers correspond to today's date, 11/23.","date":"Nov 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Nature's secret code","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241123_FibonacciAloe%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1f296b05a27925c2da92265f59d3a259","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
