International Day for Biological Diversity is about celebrating this web of life that keeps our planet thriving. Biodiversity ties into everything, from sustainable farming and clean water to climate action and disaster preparedness. A decline in biodiversity can increase the spread of zoonotic diseases—those transmitted from animals to humans. In contrast, protecting biodiversity strengthens our ability to prevent and respond to health crises like pandemics. Recognizing its crucial role for current and future generations, the United Nations observes this day each year to raise awareness and foster action for conserving the planet's biological treasures.","date":"May 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Baobab boulevard","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250522_BaobabAvenue%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2bbaa5cb4459800f657b3daa3eee3e88","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
