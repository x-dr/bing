Neptune's Grotto is a stunning stalactite cave that sits just over 3 feet above sea level. First discovered by local fishermen in the 18th century, the grotto was named after the Roman god of the sea. The entire cave complex stretches on for around 2.5 miles, although visitors can only access about 1,000 feet of the total. Inside, there's a labyrinth of lit pathways winding past stalactite and stalagmite formations, leading to a 390-foot-long saltwater lake.","date":"Jan 19, 2025","bsTitle":"A grotto fit for a god","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250119_NeptunesGrotto%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c512e90fa5e35819427620c25a347144","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
