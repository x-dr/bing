The Giant's Tomb, as the hill is known in English, resembles a giant resting in the crook of the 130-mile-long Semois River. The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colors, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers.","date":"Nov 27, 2024","bsTitle":"The giant's resting place","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241127_SemoisRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"58697e8e608c77bb8d6d9eb869726077","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
