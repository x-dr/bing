This bird is part of the monarch flycatcher family, which also includes shrikebills, magpie-larks, and paradise flycatchers. Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, the black-naped monarch prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. It perches upright on its short legs and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds occupy the dense understory of the forest canopy.","date":"Mar 28, 2025","bsTitle":"A cozy cradle","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250328_NestingMonarch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9438726c9dbc85ad59df3ededc21d9e5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
