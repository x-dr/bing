They are formed by a combination of eroding mountains to the north that supply sand, prevailing winds that move it, and surrounding mountains that trap it from the south—creating a stunning landscape of rippling sand hills. Named after the resilient mesquite trees that grow here, the dunes offer breathtaking views at sunrise and sunset, as well as exceptional stargazing opportunities.","date":"Jul 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Sands of time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250706_MesquiteFlats%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c34c145f12636ce1f5de0d2e753eede8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
