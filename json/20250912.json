First observed in 2022, World Dolphin Day shines a light on these intelligent marine mammals and the oceans they rely on. The day encourages people to learn about their behavior and the threats they face. Over 40 dolphin species swim our seas, from the Māui dolphin to the Irrawaddy dolphin. They're expert navigators, problem-solvers, and team players. Some even form superpods—temporary gatherings of hundreds or thousands of dolphins moving together offshore.","date":"Sep 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Swim wild, swim free","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250912_SpinnerDolphins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e7204015e5a212fa4f4d7caf94903223","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
