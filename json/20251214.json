Instead of hunting for bargains, they hunt for birds—with pencils, rather than pellets. Started in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman, the count offered a peaceful alternative to the Christmas 'side hunts,' where people competed to shoot the most animals. Chapman had a better idea: count them instead.
