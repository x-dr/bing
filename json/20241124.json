Established in 1934, the park encompasses 17 miles of Northern California coastline between Jenner and Bodega Bay. Wildlife enthusiasts can spot seals, sea lions, whales, and a variety of birds like towhees, warblers, finches, sparrows, and orioles. History buffs will enjoy exploring the sea stack formation with rubbing marks believed to have been made by mammoths that roamed the area 40,000 years ago. The park is also home to historical sites like Bodega Head, where Russians built a fort in the early 1800s.","date":"Nov 24, 2024","bsTitle":"Tides and twilight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241124_SonomaCoast%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3a7bb2e26badf21472319bd431911207","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
