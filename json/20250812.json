Every year on August 12, we celebrate World Elephant Day—a global movement to raise awareness about the majestic giants that roam places like Amboseli National Park in Kenya, pictured here. What makes elephants so extraordinary isn't just their size; it's their minds. These animals have incredible memories. Matriarchs, the oldest females, can recall the locations of water sources from decades past, and they use that knowledge to lead their herds through tough times. Their social bonds run just as deep. Elephants live in close-knit families, mourn their dead, and have even been observed comforting one another during hard times.","date":"Aug 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Wild, wise, and wonderful","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250812_KenyaElephants%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c52b98229b8989b42a44ebad55237809","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
