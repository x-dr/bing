It commemorates Prince Rama's victorious return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after defeating the demon king Ravana. The festival also honors the goddess Lakshmi, who is believed to bring wealth and well-being into homes, while some communities worship the goddess Kali. During Diwali, families clean and decorate their homes, exchange sweets, and gather for prayers, creating an atmosphere of joy. Central to the celebration are diyas, small oil lamps whose glowing flames symbolize light overcoming darkness and the promise of new beginnings.","date":"Oct 21, 2025","bsTitle":"Glowing traditions","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251021_DiyaDiwali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1bc2aaafa0db81a8c5b1a9677e376a92","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
