No more berries, avocados, or even coffee. Alongside butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds, bees pollinate nearly 90% of the world's wild flowering plants and over 35% of the food crops we rely on. World Bee Day, marked every May 20, honors these vital pollinators and celebrates Anton Janša, a pioneer of modern beekeeping. Janša saw bees as the noblest of insects, an idea now backed by science.","date":"May 20, 2025","bsTitle":"Small wings, big job","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250520_HoneyBeeLavender%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7eb4e4532f14b86acb8cfd05d5a27004","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
