The Everglades is not a typical swamp or river. It is a slow, shallow sheet of water that drifts south across flat grasslands toward Florida Bay, linking forests, marshes, mangroves, and coastal prairies. This subtropical wilderness supports hundreds of species, including alligators, manatees, and the endangered Florida panther. On December 6, 1947, the United States established the Everglades National Park, protecting over 1.5 million acres and shifting conservation toward preserving entire ecosystems rather than isolated landmarks.","date":"Dec 6, 2025","bsTitle":"Florida's living wetlands","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251206_EvergladesSunrise%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2ba6d80be706ad1599885be858cc8d2e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
