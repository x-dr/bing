Established in 1980, the park is home to diverse wildlife, including the Malayan tapir, white-handed gibbon, gaur, and hornbill, making it an ideal destination for anyone ready to swap city noise for jungle sounds. There are trails to tackle, kayaks to paddle, and, if you're fortunate, you might even catch a glimpse of the massive (and stinky) Rafflesia flower when it's in bloom.","date":"Mar 5, 2025","bsTitle":"A jungle adventure","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250305_SuratThani%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e112ed6b3e208973b58eba444eaeea75","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
