At 10,026 feet, Piz Nair of the Albula Alps keeps an eye over the Engadine valley in Graubünden. Start in St. Moritz: hop on the funicular (a type of cable railway system) to Corviglia, then ride the cable car to the summit. At the top? A viewing platform and that famous ibex (an alpine goat) statue. There's also a restaurant where you can eat inside a glass cube with 360° views.","date":"Aug 14, 2025","bsTitle":"Taking it from the top","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250814_PizNairPeak%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5e6c6b1b306fad2d6578ed6e3257cf0e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
