Tracing over 300 miles along the coast of the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, this UNESCO World Heritage Site offers a unique landscape of tidal flats and wetlands. In fact, it is the world's largest unbroken intertidal zone—underwater at high tide and exposed at low tide—of sand and mud flats. The area is also a playground for aquatic species such as houting fish, brown trout, and white-beaked dolphins, and is home to birds like waders and herons.","date":"Nov 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Mud, sea, and sky","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241116_FrieslandNetherlands%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"d645b82aa2891f1ffa45b9214bc7a1b3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
