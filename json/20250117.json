Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 4 feet in length and having a wingspan of 6.5 feet. It's a marine-dwelling species and can be spotted along the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from New Jersey to the mouth of the Amazon River. On the Pacific coast, it can be spotted from British Columbia all the way to Peru, including a stop at the Galápagos Islands.","date":"Jan 17, 2025","bsTitle":"Pouch perfect","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250117_PelicanPortrait%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"922b23cff1aa8487831c4ce82ca02748","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
