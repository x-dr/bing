Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. After falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer.","date":"Feb 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Scottish strategy at its finest","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250226_ArgyllStalker%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"29b7d9e4d2950eb44a3d5561282acace","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
