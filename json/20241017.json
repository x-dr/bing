The planet is dotted with frosty dunes, largely located in the high latitudes of the northern plains. Mars' atmosphere is composed of nearly 96% carbon dioxide, which is why carbon ice forms on the surface. These dunes showcase the dynamic interaction between Mars' thin atmosphere, its surface, and seasonal temperature changes.","date":"Oct 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Astronauts, grab your skis!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241017_MarsDunes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1a48f3b55c6353063656e4a13ecb132a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
