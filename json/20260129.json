Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighborhood as well.","date":"Jan 29, 2026","bsTitle":"A tall story of Milwaukee","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260129_MilwaukeeHall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8e310a6dbe6ec521f85480315c8aaf4e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
