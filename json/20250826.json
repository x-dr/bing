These are whitewashed stone houses topped with dry-stacked limestone roofs shaped like upside-down ice cream cones. It's an ancient building technique, and in this case, a clever one. Back in the 14th century, locals were reportedly trying to avoid property taxes by constructing homes that could be quickly dismantled when the king's tax collector came around.","date":"Aug 26, 2025","bsTitle":"A 'trulli' remarkable town","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250826_TrulliHouses%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e7231458ee5cef7bedba833f4130963d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
