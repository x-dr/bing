These canines thrive in this ecosystem in British Columbia, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the gray wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Unlike other wolf species, they have a marine-based diet, consisting of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters, and seals. These animals live in packs, communicating with each other through growls, barks, and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen.","date":"Nov 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Wolves in the wild","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241107_CanadaWolves%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9e4c296ef9540e279595aba4ea24453b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
