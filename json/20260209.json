Similar in size to a house cat but longer-legged and slenderer, it generally measures 15–30 inches long, with a tail about 7–12 inches. Depending on the region, adults weigh roughly 1–16 pounds. Their appearance varies widely: southern individuals tend to have warm golden coats, while those farther north often have pale gray fur that thickens for winter.","date":"Feb 9, 2026","bsTitle":"Patterns in motion","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260209_LeopardCat%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"28cd7b36a40322b2e7b70dc6ec015d4b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
