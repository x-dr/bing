Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the River Ebro, this Catalan village offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense. Today, you'll spot kayakers, ferry boats, and visitors drifting through the same currents where Crusaders once crossed.","date":"May 29, 2025","bsTitle":"Flowing through the centuries","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250529_MiravetSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f9f3c63e04857d6bdc98cd59f71a4d30","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
