Steeped in timeless lore, the city is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, epics composed as poems and set in the ancient Hindu kingdoms of India. The region's name itself holds a spiritual significance, derived from the Sanskrit words 'Shiva-Mukha,' meaning the 'face of Shiva,' the Hindu god. It is home to several temples, including the Sharavati Temple, dedicated to Shiva, and a temple in the Kodachadri hills that offers vistas of the Western Ghats mountain range.","date":"Feb 21, 2025","bsTitle":"A tale of still waters","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250221_ChampakaSarasi%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"12b86c160642278bf19f4fa842987487","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
