Butchart Gardens in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, knows how to put on a bloom show. In spring, roses scent the air, tulips line the paths, and something new blooms around every turn. But it didn't always look this way. In the early 1900s, Robert Pim Butchart operated a limestone quarry here. His wife, Jennie, saw potential in the depleted pit and began planting flowers in 1904. Now spread across 55 acres, the garden is home to more than 900 plant species—and each spring, almost 300,000 bulbs bloom.","date":"May 25, 2025","bsTitle":"Bloom where you're planted","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250525_ButchartFlowers%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8a1341f291aa87e1fe58ae674f169078","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
