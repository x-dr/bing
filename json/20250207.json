In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky.","date":"Feb 7, 2025","bsTitle":"Stuck in a blue moment","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250207_BlueNorway%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9c47084982478c17b3743ec1b4a9b0b8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
