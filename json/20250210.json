Over 4,000 years ago, in ancient Egypt, Assyria, and China, these foldable canopies were first used to shield people from the sun. It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?","date":"Feb 10, 2025","bsTitle":"Under my umbrella","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250210_UmbrellaDay%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"25f01d03a8498f06d5bf100b587b0f1c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
