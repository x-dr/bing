A Burns Night supper blends warmth and wit: the centerpiece is haggis, a savory pudding made from minced meat, oats, and spices, served with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes). Add plenty of good cheer, readings of Burns's verse, and a dram of whisky, and you have a celebration that ends with a rousing chorus of 'Auld Lang Syne.' Even if you're celebrating stateside, these traditions are easy to adopt—set the table, cue the poetry, and let the toasts flow.","date":"Jan 25, 2026","bsTitle":"Tradition burns bright","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260125_BurnsPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b1e8b4e049724d8a1856a02f0a0452ef","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
