The Royal Alcázar of Seville, in the southern region of Andalusia, stands on the site of a 10th-century citadel, which was expanded over the following 200 years. When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, this historic palace was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today.","date":"Oct 13, 2024","bsTitle":"The splendor of Seville","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241013_AlcazarSeville%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1a4fee0f6585261a6720b8be9248bd99","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
