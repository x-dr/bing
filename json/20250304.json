Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs, and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins.","date":"Mar 4, 2025","bsTitle":"Not your ordinary Tuesday","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250304_MardiGrasJackson%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1ace7793a3a5d2db50675978e7e277c7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
