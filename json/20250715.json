Active from mid-July through late August, this year it reaches its spectacular peak on the night of August 12 and into the early hours of August 13. The Perseids light up the skies when Earth passes through a trail of icy and rocky debris left behind by Comet Swift–Tuttle, which last passed close to our planet in 1992. These meteors are called the Perseids because they appear to streak from the direction of the constellation Perseus.","date":"Jul 15, 2025","bsTitle":"Timeless glow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250715_PerseidsPine%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e672da1044e3f68fba710a5d89794888","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
