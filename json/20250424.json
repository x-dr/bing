Stretching over 1,000 square miles, this landscape features fjords, river valleys, and alpine landscapes. More than half of the terrain is blanketed in ice. Throughout the 20th century, the park's glaciers have receded, uncovering new land for plant and animal life to take root. From ancient Sitka spruces to delicate fireweed shoots and moss carpeting the forest floor, plant life in Kenai Fjords flourishes. The park is also home to diverse terrestrial and marine mammals, including timber wolves, porcupines, Canadian lynxes, and cetaceans like orcas and fin whales. It also hosts a variety of birds, such as bald eagles and Peale's peregrine falcons.","date":"Apr 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Rugged peaks and wild waters","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250424_KenaiSpires%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"adb81ddc8fc4bd5a1f8ac2af19abca84","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
