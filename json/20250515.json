The Great Clock has marked time for Londoners since 1859, ringing from what is now known as the Elizabeth Tower. In 2012, officials renamed the Clock Tower as Elizabeth Tower to honor Queen Elizabeth II during her Diamond Jubilee. At 316 feet tall, the tower is part of the grand Palace of Westminster. The clock has stopped only for maintenance and rare disruptions, such as bomb damage during each world war. Each of its four clock faces spans 22.5 feet, with the minute hands measuring 14 feet.","date":"May 15, 2025","bsTitle":"London o'clock","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250515_LondonParliament%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"cd1fe4d0c20635519c54174d6425b4fa","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
