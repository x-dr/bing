This ancient formation, pictured here, seems as if nature itself has sculpted a mythical creature forever poised to drink from the sea. Estimated to be 500 million years old, the rock's uncanny resemblance to a horse bending its neck is the result of wind and wave erosion. As one of the region's oldest and most iconic landmarks, it attracts hikers, photographers, and nature lovers year-round. The best views are from the elevated track between Camel Rock and Murunna Point, while the more daring can scramble around from Camel Rock Surf Beach, though only safely at low tide.","date":"Jun 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Horsing around the coastline","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250626_HorseheadRock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"097123bd0fa1d597f5fea5269c272594","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
