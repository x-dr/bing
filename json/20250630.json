Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of TNT, a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan, and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.","date":"Jun 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Rock-solid defense","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250630_WolfeCrater%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b42632d73c03dfc6b2028715008438bc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
