Literally. With over 3 miles of sand, a historic pier, and the Pacific Coast Highway keeping things scenic, this beach is more than just a pretty shoreline. Let's start with the sand. Wide, clean, and ready for volleyball or just flopping down with a good book, it's ideal for sunbathers and sandcastle architects alike. And yes, 'Baywatch' was filmed along Santa Monica Bay. Feel free to run in slow motion.","date":"Sep 5, 2025","bsTitle":"A pier-fect evening","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250905_SunsetPier%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"5dba567c49f10b952e8e71e9534b8ae0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
