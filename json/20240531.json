Picture yourself strolling through its narrow lanes, surrounded by rolling hills, lush pastures, and stone cottages, with the roar of the Swale River your only soundtrack. Designated in 1954, the national park is spread across 841 square miles, and there are over 1,000 farms in this area. One of the area's most distinctive features are its dry stone walls; built without any kind of mortar, they can last hundreds of years. There are thought to be over 5,000 miles of these walls in the Dales.","date":"May 31, 2024","bsTitle":"A green and pleasant land","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240531_YorkshireDalesNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"354ce51e0349643d72b5cacb0e5c981b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
