At 18 feet or more, giraffes are the world's tallest land mammals. Along with prehensile tongues that are more than a foot and a half long, they use their impressive height to eat foliage found almost 20 feet from the ground. They're also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 37 mph. Giraffes are common in East Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands, and reserves.","date":"Nov 25, 2024","bsTitle":"Life in the wild","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241125_AmboseliGiraffes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8e3a25f7c7192b22ae69e2e77fde29c7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
