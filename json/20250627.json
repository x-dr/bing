The splendid leaf frog (aka splendid tree frog) is a rainforest resident with a flair for the dramatic: neon legs, sticky feet, and a disappearing act. One minute it's a humble green leaf, the next it's a flash of color mid-leap, startling predators. This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.","date":"Jun 27, 2025","bsTitle":"A splendid creature","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250627_SplendidFrog%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f5d317646a0e055ee8cbe88b0e9b19df","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
