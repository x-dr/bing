Perched on the rugged cliffs of the Ligurian coast, it's one of the five villages that make up Cinque Terre National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The name 'Manarola' might have evolved from the Latin 'Magna rota,' which means 'large wheel,' a nod to the village's historical mill wheel.","date":"Nov 14, 2024","bsTitle":"A cliffside story","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241114_ManarolaItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ec560a72080c6ba49512122cf26653e9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
