Tucked in the heart of Jordan's arid desert landscapes, this ancient city once thrived as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in the 2nd century BCE. It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece, and India. The city was abandoned for around 500 years before being rediscovered in 1812, earning it the 'Lost City' moniker.","date":"Jan 22, 2025","bsTitle":"Finding beauty in the Lost City","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250122_PetraMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f37426dd4dcb33c58b4b5aafe9099c38","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
