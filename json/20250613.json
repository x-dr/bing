This uninhabited green islet sits quietly just south of the town of Vila Franca do Campo. Beneath its serene surface, this gem holds a lively past. First documented in 1537, around the time when settlers from São Miguel began expanding westward, Vila Franca Islet has played many roles throughout its history. It has served as a military fort, a port, a vineyard site, and even a lookout for whale-watching.","date":"Jun 13, 2025","bsTitle":"The ocean's hidden heartbeat","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250613_SanMiguelAzores%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"67a021d0fbe0282c6b601f75ef994281","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
