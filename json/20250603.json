For World Bicycle Day, today's image captures bicycles lined up on a bridge in the Dutch city of Utrecht. More than half the journeys around the city happen on bikes, surpassing cars and other modes of travel. Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists. And thanks to the famously flat landscape, cycling here feels as natural as walking.","date":"Jun 3, 2025","bsTitle":"Break for joy","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250603_BicyclesUtrecht%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"aca85c90440045a9e72d0f0c60907052","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
