As an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, his theory of natural selection revolutionized our understanding of species, evolution, and our role in the natural world. His work, 'On the Origin of Species,' published in 1859, laid the foundation for modern evolutionary biology. This day marks the birthday of Darwin and honors his genius while promoting curiosity, science, and critical thinking.","date":"Feb 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Darwin's blueprint","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250212_GalapagosIguana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"28cafda853d1f92fc0bb335b576aa2e9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
