These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image. Today, on National Bison Day, observed every first Saturday in November, we honor these noble creatures—a testament to the American spirit and the monumental conservation efforts to save them.","date":"Nov 2, 2024","bsTitle":"From near extinction to national icon","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241102_BisonYellowstone%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2129dda4755960dc9351913565a5bf7d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
