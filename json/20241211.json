Among them are the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, or the 'Three Peaks of Lavaredo,' seen on the right in today's image. A part of the Sexten Dolomites in northeastern Italy, they're one of the most famous mountain groups in the Alps. These three peaks—Cima Grande, Cima Ovest, and Cima Piccola—are a UNESCO World Heritage Site that captivates adventurers and nature lovers alike. During World War I, the front line between Italy and Austria-Hungary cut through the peaks, leaving the area with many remnants of the conflict, such as fortifications, trenches, tunnels, and commemorative plaques.","date":"Dec 11, 2024","bsTitle":"The triumphant trio","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241211_DolomitesSky%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f79a6d99e76dd56fa414dd2e075866c1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
