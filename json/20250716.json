Originally built on Philae Island, it was moved to nearby Agilkia Island to save it from flooding. The international rescue effort, launched by UNESCO in the 1960s, required a monumental effort that involved moving more than 40,000 stones. Today, it's a peaceful spot surrounded by the Nile—perfect for a scenic boat ride and a journey into the past.","date":"Jul 16, 2025","bsTitle":"Illuminated by Isis","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250716_TemplePhilae%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"62aa122fbe74a3bdc4090f8a7ed81f00","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
