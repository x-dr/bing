Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 95 feet tall and 980 feet wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located just 169 miles north of Hanoi, this waterfall have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall.","date":"Jan 4, 2025","bsTitle":"A borderline paradise","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250104_VietnamFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"af35307dc110cfc79427867a87f58b36","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
