This area has served as a natural resource for humans and animals for centuries, with the Rainbow River—flowing through the park—playing a major role. The gently winding waterway is fed by Rainbow Springs, one of Florida's largest springs. The water that bubbles up here comes from a 770-square-mile area and eventually flows into the Withlacoochee River.","date":"Jul 3, 2025","bsTitle":"The clear embrace of Rainbow River","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250703_RainbowRiver%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c1024f0b653042f0a2650b9776167024","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
