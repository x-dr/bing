Let's explore their life. African lion cubs like those featured here, sunbathing in the wilderness of South Africa, start life tucked away in a secluded den. Blind at birth, these little ones are vulnerable in the first few weeks of their lives and depend entirely on their mothers. At around 8 weeks old, they meet the rest of the pride and learn to socialize so they can find their place in the group. After they hit 6 months, they begin to go out hunting with adults, learning essential skills through real-life adventures.","date":"Nov 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Sunrise on the savanna","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241121_LionCubs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"66705acb4fa684d95281b4d33abe197a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
