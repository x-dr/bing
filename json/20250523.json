Turtles and tortoises thrive in a variety of environments and are linked to wisdom and perseverance. All tortoises are turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. While turtles are smaller and built for swimming, tortoises are larger, heavier, and adapted for life on land. The American Tortoise Rescue (ATR) established World Turtle Day to raise awareness and protection efforts on May 23 each year. ATR has helped rehabilitate, rescue, and rehome around 4,000 turtles and tortoises, working to protect them and their disappearing habitats.","date":"May 23, 2025","bsTitle":"Shell yeah!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250523_ButterflyTurtle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ef182edbfe0025a03c103aa0ede552f9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
