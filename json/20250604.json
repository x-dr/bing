On the island's eastern coast lies Cala Luna, featured here—a beach in the Gulf of Orosei. Rising at the mouth of Rio Illune, this beach is at the end of the Codula di Luna canyon. It is a haven of golden sand, surrounded by white cliffs that rise more than 950 feet into the sky—perfect for rock climbing.","date":"Jun 4, 2025","bsTitle":"Crisp blues, sharp views","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250604_CalaLuna%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b2e83a37e5cdcd12153bf936ac90850f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
