While these towers can be found in many places, today's image shows some at Mono Lake in Mono County, California. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981.","date":"Dec 5, 2024","bsTitle":"The rise of tufa","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241205_MonoTufa%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8ffd33dd95f59bc47a52c88adae148e5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
