Found in Southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, these striking giants are not true trees but a species of aloe adapted to life under the desert's scorching sun. Their thick trunks store water, while their branches reflect heat, helping them endure harsh conditions. Reaching up to 23 feet in height, with some living for more than 100 years, quiver trees are also vital to their ecosystem. They offer rare perches and nesting sites for birds in landscapes where few other trees exist.","date":"Nov 13, 2025","bsTitle":"Quivering under starlight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251113_AloeDichotoma%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f800670e8e3f4a31e4173252646a48f3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
