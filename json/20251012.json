Despite its name, this village isn't directly on the Saranac Lakes themselves but rather on Lake Flower, a wide section of the Saranac River. For centuries, the area—nicknamed 'The Capital of the Adirondacks'—was used by Indigenous peoples for hunting and travel. By the late 19th century, it gained fame as a health retreat, where Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau pioneered fresh-air treatment for tuberculosis. The cure cottages from that era still stand today.","date":"Oct 12, 2025","bsTitle":"Falling for Saranac","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251012_SaranacLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9651cb8a6d4b9c4c5f14fc6832895bdc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
