Welcome to the maritime forest of Cumberland Island National Seashore on the southernmost stretch of Georgia's Atlantic coast. Salt spray, sandy soil, hurricanes? The trees here stand their ground. Live oaks bend but don't break. Saw palmettos crowd the ground like leafy bodyguards, while Spanish moss hangs from branches like nature's fringe. This maritime forest is one of the best remaining examples of this rare habitat in the United States. Thanks to its national seashore status, the island has been spared from the concrete creep seen on other coastlines.","date":"Jun 17, 2025","bsTitle":"Coastal quiet, untamed life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250617_CumberlandOaks%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2356d5cae542bf85234ca05a24b578bd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
