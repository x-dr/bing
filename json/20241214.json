Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a 15-mile diameter, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species.","date":"Dec 14, 2024","bsTitle":"'Hoo' said that?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241214_NorthernHawkOwl%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"053192a2c8e28dd5596ab10950745f69","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
