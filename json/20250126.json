There are several species worldwide, but the European beech steals the spotlight in much of Europe. With its smooth gray bark, short trunk, and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 160-foot-tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring, and even kitchen tools.","date":"Jan 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Aging gracefully","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250126_FrostedBeech%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b1c13ba08b2623c01e372d3db6369184","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
