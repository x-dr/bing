In the center, we have a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbor, on the left side of the picture, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 440-foot summit for breathtaking panoramic views.","date":"Mar 30, 2025","bsTitle":"Harboring nice views","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250330_SydneyHarbour%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2032698753ff2f5a65062dfc7b96f509","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
