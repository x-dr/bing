What you see at Arches National Park, Utah, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift, and weathering. These arches were formed when salt beds were left behind by ancient seas. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. These formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The park was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was later upgraded to national park status in 1971.","date":"Jun 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Nature took its time","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250624_DelicateArch%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"f40b1f144417b63cf81656fc58de6a7a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
