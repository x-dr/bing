The redwood groves of Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) in California are home to some of the tallest trees on Earth, soaring over 370 feet high. The combined RNSP contain Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Some of these redwoods were alive when the Mayans built their temples, and the Great Wall of China was under construction. Protected since 1968, the park preserves nearly half of the world's remaining old-growth redwoods.","date":"Apr 26, 2025","bsTitle":"Park it here","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250426_RedwoodGrove%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ccda08dee95d3b37454cda58efaf6014","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
