These striking animals, known for their unique black and white patterns, are mostly found in the African savanna, stretching from Kenya to South Africa. Of the three zebra species, Grévy's zebra, plains zebra, and mountain zebra, the Grévy's zebra is the most endangered, with more than half its population lost in only three decades. While plains zebras are thriving, mountain zebras face significant threats, such as poaching and habitat encroachment. Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home.","date":"Jan 31, 2025","bsTitle":"Anything but plain","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250131_PlainsZebra%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"071b96055f55ea480ffe2d150725f019","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
