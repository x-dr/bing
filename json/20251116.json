The traboules, a network of hidden passageways threading between courtyards and buildings, turn a simple stroll into a treasure hunt. They were the original shortcuts, allowing residents to dodge rain, carry goods, or move discreetly through the medieval quarters. Today, they're less about practicality and more about discovery. These passages date back to the fourth century but became essential during the Renaissance, when silk traders used them to shuttle delicate fabrics safely from workshops to the river without braving the weather. Later, during World War II, Resistance fighters used the traboules as escape routes.","date":"Nov 16, 2025","bsTitle":"Passages with a past","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251116_LyonTraboules%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b9a224c87f9394fcfdbc37f86d3a70d5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
