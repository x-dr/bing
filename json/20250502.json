This water bird, also known as the mangrove heron, is about 16 inches tall. It is a master of patience, waiting to ambush its prey. It uses clever tactics, such as dropping feathers or insects to lure fish. Common in the wetlands of South America, the striated heron is also found in North America, Australia, Africa, Asia, New Guinea, and the Pacific islands.","date":"May 2, 2025","bsTitle":"Sailing solo","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250502_BrazilHeron%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"56af115886e10b834d154ff1845dfb8c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
