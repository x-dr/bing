The males look like they're wearing a bright orange-red costume, complete with a huge crest that almost covers their beak. With its bold colors, this native South American bird isn't just about looks—it's got the moves too. The Andean and Guianan cock-of-the-rock are renowned for their theatrical courtship dances, making them true head-turners of the feathered kingdom. Females are far less flashy, with brownish feathers that help them stay hidden. During the mating season, males gather in leks—noisy display arenas—where they hop, squawk, and shake their heads in an effort to impress a female. She watches, picks the best dancer, mates, and then flies off to build a concave, cup-shaped mud nest on a rocky surface.","date":"Apr 17, 2025","bsTitle":"Double the drama","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250417_EcuadorBird%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dd4c9dfdbe7171ecab09237d3c8a3f26","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
