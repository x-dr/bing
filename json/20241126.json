November 26 is World Olive Tree Day, so we're taking some time to appreciate this amazing plant. Olive trees were first cultivated in the eastern Mediterranean around 8,000 years ago. From there, they were introduced to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then farther afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood, and fruit for millennia.","date":"Nov 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Beneath ancient olive trees","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241126_TrulliGrove%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9598d9d0c76b004c259674508e91179a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
