Smith State Park, Georgia","copyrightonly":"© Chris Moore/TANDEM Stills + Motion","desc":"The sturdy, swamp-loving, cypress trees pictured in the mist on our homepage can grow over 100 feet tall. These towering specimens are found in George L. Smith State Park, which spans 1,634 acres in Emanuel County, Georgia. The park's centerpiece is a 412-acre mill pond, a favorite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the southeastern US. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all.","date":"Oct 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Standing tall in fall","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241021_AutumnCypress%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8376521df0327ce4dcde6e3d778607c3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
