For a few hours a day, you can wander across a centuries-old granite causeway made smooth by pilgrims and fishermen. This is St. Michael's Mount, just off the coast of Marazion, in Cornwall, England. Managed by the National Trust and home to the St. Aubyn family since the 1600s, the mount blends myth, medieval history, and sweeping coastal views.","date":"Jan 30, 2026","bsTitle":"Where the sea makes way","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260130_StMichaelsCornwall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a03e002c1e91b5c0133252b9bec51025","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
