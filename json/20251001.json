Nestled in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite's nearly 1,200 square miles cradle granite giants, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoias. Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image. It was named after Galen Clark, Yosemite's first guardian and a pioneer of conservation.","date":"Oct 1, 2025","bsTitle":"Echoes from the Clark Range","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20251001_YosemiteClark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"dd877929fe694df326c0ce08cd330a7e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
