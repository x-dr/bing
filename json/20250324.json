These extremely arid regions receive less than 2.75 inches of annual rainfall. Compared to other bush elephants, desert elephants have longer legs, broader feet, and slightly smaller bodies. These resilient herbivores migrate between waterholes, following ancient routes based on seasonal food and water availability. Male desert elephants often roam alone over vast areas, while female-led family groups stay near rivers, where food is more plentiful. Their incredible adaptability is showcased by their ability to travel long distances, sometimes 43 miles in a single night, to find their favorite myrrh bushes.","date":"Mar 24, 2025","bsTitle":"Feasting in the tall grass","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250324_ElephantGrass%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"bf1ad4bfb165094eac4dcf9311e043c8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
