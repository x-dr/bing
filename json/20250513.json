Established on this day in 1959, Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia turns 66 years old today and covers over 448,000 acres. Originally called Grey Lake National Tourism Park, it was renamed in 1970 and later designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1978. Its most recognizable feature—the three massive granite peaks known as the Torres—stands over 8,000 feet tall. These formations took shape through magma intrusion and uplift, followed by millions of years of glacial erosion, leaving behind the jagged spires seen today.","date":"May 13, 2025","bsTitle":"66 and still gorgeous","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250513_TorresChile%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"804531558f24d864626909fc74f3b7ee","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
