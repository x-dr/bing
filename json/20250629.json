The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America, and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature, and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation, and fast-paced urban growth.","date":"Jun 29, 2025","bsTitle":"Where history gets spicy","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250629_BandaIsland%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"48be72a049748517b69debd7f4f4bfb2","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
