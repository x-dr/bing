Tolkien Day","copyrightonly":"© pongnathee kluaythong/Getty Images","desc":"Our picture of the day takes us to the Swiss village of Lauterbrunnen, where the Staubbach Falls shimmers in the distance beyond a quiet alpine valley. This is the landscape a young traveler, J.R.R. Tolkien, crossed during a hiking trip in 1911, long before he became the storyteller behind 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Its soaring cliffs, silver waterfalls, and crisp mountain air left a lasting impression and are believed to have inspired his vision of Rivendell, the elven refuge hidden deep in Middle-earth.","date":"Jan 3, 2026","bsTitle":"The steps before the saga","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20260103_LauterbrunnenValley%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8d1d7f62ef11d8ea4b7a9e312d06a839","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
