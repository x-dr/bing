That is, in the Tibetan calendar at least. Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead.","date":"Feb 28, 2025","bsTitle":"Have a rest at the Tiger's Nest","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20250228_BhutanMonastery%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3eb937ac8ed4671716385f8cbc7175b4","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
